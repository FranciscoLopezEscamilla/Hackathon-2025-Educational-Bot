Understanding generative arts in the age of Artificial \\nIntelligence (AI) is seen as a way forward to remain relevant. Through the use of a practice -\\nbased research methodology, the article explores principles, processes, and tools for generating \\nart through coding. Practical samples are used to demonstrate the potential of generative art \\nthrough basic coding examples. This research also highlights the role of generative art in \\nfostering interdisciplinary collaboration and transcending the boundaries of conventional art \\nforms. \\nKeywords: Generative Arts, Python, Artificial Intelligence \\n \\nINTRODUCTION \\nThe computer plays a very important role in our life nowadays. Almost every task is connected \\nto the computer. From ordering groceries online to using public transportation to driving a car \\nor communicating with other people. One part that plays an even mo re important role in \\ntechnology is artificial intelligence. Although it has been with us for quite some time, the term \\nstill inspires fear and awe. Most of us are still wondering about its potential and future. AI can \\nbe used in managing traffic routes, pr oducts, movies, and location suggestions, and as virtual \\nassistants such as chatbots, search engines, banks, and so on (Aela, 2023). \\nRecently, the art world has been transformed by the advent of technology, especially \\nAI and generative arts. Many types of art can now be easily made with the help of a computer. \\nWith the advancement of AI, many high -quality artworks can be created with less time and \\nresources. The technology has achieved significant results in generating visual, animated, and \\naudio content (Hodgkins, 2023). \\nAI is more or less comparable to the advent of photography more than a hundred years \\nago. Everyone was shocked when it first appeared. However, it has become a tool for artists to'),\n",

AI \\nis modernizing some processes, but it still requires human involvement to create something \\nuseful and, most importantly, interesting. Therefore, AI can be seen as a tool that complements \\nand enhances the work of designers and artists to make their work more productive and efficient. \\nDesigners can fill the gap between human touch and creativity, which is fundamental to the \\nartwork. Unlike computers, artists are endowe d with their own emotions and unique \\nperspectives (Nigeria, 2023). \\nGenerative art, also known as procedural art or algorithmic art, is a form of art that \\ncreates itself independently. This can take the form of mathematical functions that create \\ngeometric and precisely calculated works of art. In other cases, chance takes control and creates \\nchaotic artworks that incorporate abstract styles. In many cases, digital artists combine the two. \\nGenerative art comes in a variety of forms, from music to literature to digital graphics. By \\ndefinition, generative art is a form of art that is either entirely or partially created using an \\nautonomous system. Generative art is a unique combination of computer science and art. This \\nsystem can be represented by any type of algorithm: mathematical, mechanical, or biological. \\nGenerative art creation usually involves a programming language with the use of codes. \\nSimilarly, generative content that uses AI uses prompt technology to generate the desired \\ninformation. Investigating the Python programming language for generating artwo rk will \\ncontribute to the understanding of generative art and provide important and meaningful insights \\ninto artificial intelligence. \\nThis type of art is often inspired by modern art, especially Pop Art, which relies heavily \\non ordered geometric patterns. However, it is a very broad and rich category of art that has one \\ncentral characteristic. Generative art in some way involves a self -governing or autonomous \\nsystem. \\nChance is a kind of autonomous system. By incorporating chance into a piece of code \\nart, different unique pieces of art are generated each time the script is executed or in response \\nto the user's interaction. This can create different types of ideas that are available for selection. \\nThis randomness can also be orderly and autonomous or the integration of mixing and chaos. \\nAutonomous or generative art is not rejecting creativity, it finds creativity through \\ndifferent fields by building art pieces through coding. Artists may argue that generative arts will \\nkill manual art eventually. A game designer from Colorado USA recently took home the first \\nprize in the digital arts or digitally manipulated photography category at the Colorado State Fair \\nFine Arts Competition. His winning image was made with Midjourney - an Artificial \\nIntelligence system that can come up with images at a prompt.

Understanding generative arts in the age of Artificial \\nIntelligence (AI) is seen as a way forward to remain relevant. Through the use of a practice -\\nbased research methodology, the article explores principles, processes, and tools for generating \\nart through coding. Practical samples are used to demonstrate the potential of generative art \\nthrough basic coding examples. This research also highlights the role of generative art in \\nfostering interdisciplinary collaboration and transcending the boundaries of conventional art \\nforms. \\nKeywords: Generative Arts, Python, Artificial Intelligence \\n \\nINTRODUCTION \\nThe computer plays a very important role in our life nowadays. Almost every task is connected \\nto the computer. From ordering groceries online to using public transportation to driving a car \\nor communicating with other people. One part that plays an even mo re important role in \\ntechnology is artificial intelligence. Although it has been with us for quite some time, the term \\nstill inspires fear and awe. Most of us are still wondering about its potential and future. AI can \\nbe used in managing traffic routes, pr oducts, movies, and location suggestions, and as virtual \\nassistants such as chatbots, search engines, banks, and so on (Aela, 2023). \\nRecently, the art world has been transformed by the advent of technology, especially \\nAI and generative arts. Many types of art can now be easily made with the help of a computer. \\nWith the advancement of AI, many high -quality artworks can be created with less time and \\nresources. The technology has achieved significant results in generating visual, animated, and \\naudio content (Hodgkins, 2023). \\nAI is more or less comparable to the advent of photography more than a hundred years \\nago. Everyone was shocked when it first appeared. However, it has become a tool for artists to'),\n",

NumPy is \\nused with the specified width \\nand height. \\n \\n5 The art is generated by \\nmanipulating the canvas. \\n \\nThe parameters are defined by \\nthe spiral and iterate through a \\nrange of points. For each \\npoint, the position is \\ncalculated using polar \\ncoordinates, and a random \\ncolor is assigned to it. \\n \\n \\n6 Matplotlib is used to display \\nthe generated art.
